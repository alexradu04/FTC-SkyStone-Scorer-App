# SkyStone Scorer

A new Flutter project.

This is a simple app build to keep track of SkyStone scores super efficiently and super fast.

## Features:

- Cross-platform (IOS/Android available):<br>
  The app is build using the Flutter SDK and dart, therefore it is able to run on both mobile platforms.
- Smart Scoring <br>
  The app uses smartly written code in order to auto-complete fields that you would have to normally modify by yourself.
- Dark theme <br>
  The app now provides a system-native dark theme, which updates dynamically based on your operating system's theme.
  
## Description

This is just a simple project to help me experiment with the Flutter SDK and Dart programming language, as I have never built an app using flutter before.
